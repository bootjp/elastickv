# Elastickv

## Overview
Elastickv is an experimental project dedicated to building a distributed key-value store, akin to DynamoDB, but optimized for cloud environments. This initiative focuses on achieving high data consistency and availability, integrating key features like Raft-based data replication, dynamic node scaling, and automatic hot spot re-allocation. Elastickv is envisioned as a next-generation solution for efficient and scalable cloud data storage.

## Features
- **Raft-based Data Replication**: Implements data consistency and fault tolerance using the Raft consensus algorithm, essential for distributed systems.
- **Dynamic Node Scaling**: Adapts node sizes and key partitions dynamically, mirroring DynamoDB's approach for optimized cloud scalability.
- **Automatic Hot Spot Re-allocation**: Identifies and reallocates hot spots in real-time, enhancing the system's performance and efficiency in cloud environments.

## Development Status

Elastickv, in its experimental stage, strives to emulate and extend the capabilities of renowned cloud-based solutions like DynamoDB. As we develop this distributed key-value store, we invite collaboration and feedback to help shape a robust, scalable, and efficient solution for modern cloud infrastructures.
